## Testing Webhooks

### Via Management Command
```bash
# Test task completion notification
python manage.py test_webhook --event-type task_completed --project-id 1

# Test badge earned notification
python manage.py test_webhook --event-type badge_earned

# Test project creation notification
python manage.py test_webhook --event-type project_created
```

### Via API
```bash
# Test a specific webhook integration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/api/webhook-integrations/1/test/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"test_message": "Test from API!"}'
```

### Via Admin Interface
1. Go to `/admin/notifications/webhookintegration/`
2. Click on a webhook integration
3. Look for test functionality (if added to admin)

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check Notification Logs
- **Admin Interface:** `/admin/notifications/notificationlog/`
- **API:** `GET /api/notifications/api/notification-logs/`

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook URL Invalid:**
   - Verify the webhook URL is correct
   - Check if the webhook was deleted in Discord/Teams

2. **Authentication Errors:**
   - Ensure the webhook URL includes the correct token
   - Check if the bot/connector is still active

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Discord/Teams may rate limit requests
   - Check response codes in notification logs

4. **Network Issues:**
   - Check server connectivity
   - Review error messages in logs

### Status Codes
- `200/204` - Success
- `400` - Bad request (check payload format)
- `401` - Unauthorized (check webhook URL/token)
- `404` - Webhook not found (URL may be invalid)
- `429` - Rate limited (reduce notification frequency)

## Message Formats

### Discord Messages
Discord webhooks receive rich embeds with:
- Colored borders based on event type
- Event title and description
- Relevant fields (project, points, etc.)
- Timestamp and footer with Zentry branding

### Teams Messages
Teams webhooks receive MessageCard format with:
- Themed colors based on event type
- Activity title and subtitle
- Facts sections with key information
- Professional formatting for business environments

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Event Types
You can extend the system by:
1. Adding new event types to `WebhookIntegration.EVENT_TYPES`
2. Creating signal handlers for new events
3. Implementing custom payload formatting

### Filtering Events
Webhook integrations can be configured to only receive specific event types:
```json
{
    "event_types": ["task_completed", "badge_earned"]
}
```

### Project-Specific Webhooks
Each webhook integration is associated with a specific project, allowing for:
- Project-specific Discord channels
- Team-specific notifications
- Departmental separation

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook URL Security:**
   - Keep webhook URLs confidential
   - Regenerate URLs if compromised
   - Use HTTPS endpoints only

2. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Implement delays between notifications if needed
   - Monitor for unusual activity

3. **Data Privacy:**
   - Review what data is included in notifications
   - Ensure compliance with privacy policies
   - Consider sensitive information in task titles/descriptions

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check webhook integrations
python manage.py shell -c "from notifications.models import WebhookIntegration; print(WebhookIntegration.objects.all())"

# Check recent notification logs
python manage.py shell -c "from notifications.models import NotificationLog; print(NotificationLog.objects.order_by('-created_at')[:5])"

# Manually trigger webhook for testing
python manage.py test_webhook --event-type task_completed

# Check if signals are working
python manage.py shell -c "from django.db.models.signals import post_save; print(post_save.receivers)"
```
